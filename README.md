# Flex Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Flex Sensor project utilizes an Arduino Nano to measure and monitor the bending or flexing of a flex sensor. This project is useful in applications where the degree of flexion or bending needs to be measured, such as in robotics, prosthetics, or human-machine interface devices.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Flex Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Flex Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect one terminal of the flex sensor to the A0 analog input pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the other terminal of the flex sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Optionally, connect a resistor in series with the flex sensor for voltage division if needed.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the flex sensor to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - After uploading the code, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the flex sensor values displayed on the serial monitor as you bend or flex the sensor.

#### Applications

- **Robotics:** Measure the degree of bending in robotic joints for precise control and movement.
- **Prosthetics:** Monitor the flexion of prosthetic limbs to adjust movement or trigger actions.
- **Human-Machine Interface:** Use flex sensors in input devices for gesture recognition or motion tracking.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper wiring and connection between the flex sensor and the Arduino Nano.
- Calibrate the sensor if needed to adjust for different flexion ranges or sensitivities.
- Experiment with different resistance values or voltage division setups for optimal sensor performance.
